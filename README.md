# Restaurant Reviews App
---
This is a project based on code provided by Udacity, Inc. It has been modified from the original code to include responsive design, accessibility, and offline use.

## What the Restaurant Reviews App Does

With this app, users can locate, learn about, and see reviews for various restaurants in the New York City area. Users can find restaurants via a map, or they can filter restaurants by neighborhood or type of cuisine. Once users have selected a restaurant, they can get hours of operation plus read reviews.

### Responsive Design

The original code has been modified with a responsive design, so that users can have a great experience if accessing the app from a desktop or mobile devices.

### Accessibility

The code has been modified so that users can use their favorite screen reader such as ChromeVox to navigate through the site using the TAB key, arrow keys, and ENTER.

### Caching for Offline Use

Another feature that has been added is a caching. If you've visited the site before, you will still be able to access its great features even if you temporarily lose web access to the page.

### What do I do from here?

1. Download/unzip or clone this github repository to your computer.

2. In the Restaurant App folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8200` (or some other port. For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8200`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8200`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

4. Get the ChromeVox extension, and try navigating the site using the TAB, arrow, and ENTER keys.
